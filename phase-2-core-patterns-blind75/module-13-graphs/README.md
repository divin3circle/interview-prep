# Module 13: Graphs

## Pattern Overview

Graphs model relationships. Common algorithms: DFS, BFS, Topological Sort, Union-Find.

## Core Techniques

### DFS on Grid / Matrix
Standard Depth-First Search used to explore connected components (like islands) or paths.
1. **Base Case**: Check for out-of-bounds or already visited cells.
2. **Mark Visited**: Mark the current cell to prevent infinite loops.
3. **Recurse**: Explore neighbors (usually 4 directions: Up, Down, Left, Right).

## Problems
1. Number of Islands
2. Clone Graph
3. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow
4. Course Schedule
