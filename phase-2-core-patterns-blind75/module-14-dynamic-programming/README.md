# Module 14: Dynamic Programming

## Pattern Overview

Dynamic Programming breaks problems into subproblems and stores results to avoid re-computation. Two approaches: Memoization (Top-Down) and Tabulation (Bottom-Up).

## Problems
1. Climbing Stairs
2. House Robber
3. Coin Change
4. Longest Increasing Subsequence
5. Word Break
6. Unique Paths

**Key Takeaway**: Identify overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
