# Module 15: Explaining Solutions Clearly

## The REACT Framework
In an interview, **Communication > Code**. Use REACT:

1.  **R**epeat: Repeat the question to ensure understanding.
2.  **E**xamples: Walk through examples/edge cases.
3.  **A**pproach: Describe your high-level strategy (Brute force -> Optimized).
4.  **C**ode: Write clean code.
5.  **T**est: Dry run with an example.

## Whiteboarding / Text Editor Tips
- **Space Management**: Don't write in the center. Start top-left.
- **Variable Names**: Use `maxHeight` not `h`.
- **Modularize**: "I'll assume I have a helper function `isValid(node)` and implement it later" is a great way to stay focused on core logic.

## Common Mistakes
- **Jumping to Code**: Never write code until the interviewer buys into your plan.
- **Silent Coding**: Always narrate your thought process. "I'm using a HashMap here to store frequencies for O(1) lookup."
