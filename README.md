## Problem Format

Each problem in Phase 2 includes:

- **README.md**: Problem statement, examples, constraints, approach discussion
- **solution.java**: Clean, optimal solution with detailed comments
- **solution-explained.md**: Step-by-step walkthrough using the 10-step framework
- **test-cases.java**: Comprehensive test cases covering edge cases
- **variations.md**: Follow-up questions and related problems

## Key Features

### Systematic Approach

Every problem is solved using the same 10-step framework:
1. Clarify the problem requirements
2. Clarify all constraints and assumptions
3. Identify potential edge cases
4. Develop a brute-force solution first
5. Analyze time and space complexity
6. Optimize using known patterns
7. Walk through a concrete example
8. Write clean, well-structured code
9. Test verbally with edge cases
10. Discuss potential improvements and trade-offs

### Professional Content

- No emojis or casual language
- High technical accuracy
- Detailed complexity analysis
- Production-quality code with comprehensive comments
- Clear explanations suitable for interview communication

### Pattern-Based Learning

Problems are organized by pattern, not difficulty, enabling you to:
- Recognize problem types quickly
- Apply proven techniques systematically
- Build intuition through repetition
- Transfer knowledge across similar problems
