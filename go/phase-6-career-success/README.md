## Resume Optimization

### Action Verbs
"Designed", "Optimized", "Led", "Built", "Implemented", "Architected"

### Metrics
- "Reduced latency by 20%"
- "Scaled to 1M users"
- "Improved throughput by 3x"
- "Decreased memory usage by 40%"

### Skills Section
**Languages**: Go, Python, JavaScript
**Technologies**: Docker, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis
**Concepts**: Microservices, REST APIs, gRPC, CI/CD, TDD

### Go-Specific Resume Tips
- Highlight concurrency experience (goroutines, channels)
- Mention Go tools (go test, pprof, race detector)
- Include Go projects (CLI tools, APIs, microservices)
- Reference Go standard library expertise

## Portfolio Study

### GitHub Best Practices
- Host this repository on GitHub
- Write clear README files with setup instructions
- Include tests and benchmarks
- Show consistent commit history
- Add GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### Technical Writing
- Write a blog post explaining *one* hard problem deeply
- Explain your thought process and trade-offs
- Include code examples in Go
- Share on dev.to, Medium, or personal blog

### Go Portfolio Ideas
- CLI tool using `cobra` or `urfave/cli`
- REST API with `net/http` or `gin`
- gRPC service with protobuf
- Concurrent data processor
- System monitoring tool

## The Interview Day Checklist

- [ ] Good sleep (essential for cognitive function)
- [ ] Water and notebook ready
- [ ] Test internet and camera
- [ ] Have STAR stories prepared for "Tell me about yourself"
- [ ] Review Go syntax (no IDE during interview!)
- [ ] Practice whiteboarding without autocomplete
- [ ] **Smile** and be curious!

## Go Interview Preparation

### Common Go Questions
- Explain goroutines vs threads
- When to use channels vs mutexes?
- How does the garbage collector work?
- What is interface{} and type assertions?
- Explain defer, panic, recover

### Code Without IDE
Practice writing Go code on paper or whiteboard:
- Remember syntax (`:=` vs `=`, `range`, `make` vs `new`)
- Know common stdlib packages (`strings`, `strconv`, `sort`)
- Understand error handling patterns

## Salary Negotiation

### Strategy
- Don't give the first number if possible
- Research market rates (levels.fyi, Glassdoor)
- Focus on total compensation (Equity + Bonus + Base)
- Consider remote work, learning opportunities, tech stack

### Script
"I'm really excited about the team and the Go tech stack, but I was hoping to land closer to $X based on market rates for Go engineers with my experience."

### Always Be Professional
- Be polite but firm
- Express enthusiasm for the role
- Have a walk-away number in mind
- Consider the entire package (WLB, growth, tech)
