# Phase 0: Interview Foundations (Go Edition)

## Overview

Phase 0 establishes the foundational knowledge and skills required for technical interview success. This phase focuses on understanding the interview process, developing a systematic problem-solving methodology, and configuring your Go development environment for optimal productivity.

**Duration**: Approximately 60 minutes  
**Modules**: 3  
**Prerequisites**: Basic Go programming knowledge

## Learning Objectives

By completing Phase 0, you will:

- Understand the complete technical interview process from application to offer
- Recognize what signals interviewers evaluate and how to demonstrate competency
- Master a systematic 10-step framework for approaching any algorithmic problem
- Configure VS Code or GoLand for efficient problem-solving in Go
- Develop professional communication habits for technical interviews

## Module Structure

### Module 0.1: How Interviews Work
**Duration**: 20 minutes

Gain comprehensive understanding of the technical interview process, evaluation criteria, and what distinguishes strong candidates from weak ones.

**Topics Covered**:
- Interview timeline and stages
- Signal evaluation criteria
- Common misconceptions
- What interviewers look for at each stage
- How to demonstrate competency effectively

### Module 0.3: Tools Setup
**Duration**: 15 minutes

Configure your development environment for maximum efficiency during problem-solving and interviews.

**Topics Covered**:
- Go environment setup (Go CLI)
- VS Code / GoLand configuration
- Essential keyboard shortcuts
- Starter code templates
- Testing utilities setup (idiomatic `testing` package)
- Best practices for interview coding

## Completion Criteria

You have successfully completed Phase 0 when you can:

- [ ] Explain the technical interview process and evaluation criteria
- [ ] Articulate the 10-step problem-solving framework from memory
- [ ] Apply the framework to at least 3 practice problems
- [ ] Navigate your IDE (VS Code or GoLand) efficiently using keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Write clean, well-structured Go code using the provided templates

## Next Steps

After completing Phase 0, proceed to [Phase 1: DSA Foundations](../phase-1-dsa-foundations/README.md) to build your theoretical foundation in algorithms and data structures.
